## This is part of a Lottery smart contract project
Specifically, this is the very basic front-end part of the Lottery smart contract.

This project is basically created for people to able to contribute to the lottery pool. Once time is up, the winner will be selected and win the prize of the entire pool.

The only person who can pick a winner is the manager, no one else can pick a winner.

This is also a single-page React app. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a very basic application where people can only connect their wallet and send ETH to contribute to the pool.
